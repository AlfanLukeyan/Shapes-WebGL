## Introduction

This exercise is about creating a 2D square and 3D cube using WebGL. The square and cube made by using the same method, which is using the triangle strip. The difference is the cube has 6 sides, so it needs 6 triangle strips. The cube also has 8 vertices, so it needs 8 vertices. The square has 4 vertices, so it needs 4 vertices. The square and cube also have different colors. The square has 1 color, and the cube has 6 colors.
